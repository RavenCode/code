# Sprint Plan

1. Prepare *before* the meeting
  * Test your demo and have it ready
  * Write stories for the week and place them in the `Backlog`
* Enter the room *on time*
  * Bring your laptop
* Close your laptop
  * And your phone, Google glass, whatever else can distract you
* Pay attention to the introduction
  * Generally an informative video followed by a brainstorming session
* Each attendee must...
  * Demo/share what you did over the past week
    * Mark all `Delivered` Pivotal stories as `Accepted` or `Rejected`
  * Summarize what you are working on for the next week
    * Your stories should already be in the `Backlog`
* Time for questions, comments, concerns, and ideas
* Leave with an enlightened mind
* Record your high level sprint stats in `#dev_sprints`
  * Format should follow:
    Completed
    * [Completed Item 1]
    * [Completed Item 2]
    …
    Goals
    * [Goal 1]
    * [Goal 2]
    …
