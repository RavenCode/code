# Karma

We believe in karma. The more karma you have, the better.

You can redeem karma points for real things.

## Karma Points

Karma points are awarded for a successful [Standup](../Standup/README.md).

*20 Karma Points* = *1 Karma Star*


## Karma Stars

Upon being rewarded a Karma Star, it must be added to the Karma Board in the office.

Karma Stars can never be awarded to yourself. Whoever awards a Karma Star is encouraged to differentiate their star's design from all others so that the stars they award are visibly awarded by them.

*1 Karma Star* = $10 towards an office purchase (send filled purchase form to Office Admin)
*10 Karma Stars* = A team outing of your choice (within reason)
