# Karma

We believe in karma. So much so that you can redeem karma for *real things*.


<br />
## Karma Points

### Rules

Karma points are awarded for...

1. Passing your daily [Standup](../Standup/README.md)
2. Accomplishing 50% of your [Sprint Plan](../Sprint Plan/README.md) goals

### Value

**20 Karma Points** = **1 Karma Star** for you + **1 Karma Star to award to someone else**

**1 Karma Star** = **$20** towards an office purchase

**5 Karma Stars** = **A team outing** of your choice (within reason)



<br />
## Karma Stars

### Rules

1. You must log your **Karma Star** in the #karma Slack channel within 1 day of it being earned
  * Eg. "+1 to me and +1 to @amsul"
* **Karma Stars** can be pooled together with othersâ€™ consent
