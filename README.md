# We’re pretty serious about code

At PumpUp, we hold high standards for the quality of code that powers any of our products. Maintaining a healthy codebase is **crucial** for large-scale applications to be able to move fast and iterate often.

So, we are creating this guide – an ever-evolving story of how to write code.

<br />

## How this works

Each listing in the directory above is a chapter on different aspects of writing code.

Within each chapter is a `README.md` file that talks about a concept with some generic examples.

Along with each chapter’s `README.md` file, there may also be a language specific file, such as `JavaScript.md`, `Swift.md`, and `Java.md`, that goes in depth of how that concept relates to the language.
