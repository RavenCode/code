# Cleanup Hour

For one hour each week, we perform an hour of cleanup.

## Steps

1. Create a new feature branch: `feature/cleanup-YOUR_NAME`
2. Clean up any files by adding comments, removing bulk, etc.
  * Avoid conflicts by notifying relevant team members of the files you're cleaning
3. Commit your cleaned files
  * Remember to prefix your [commit messages](../Commits/README.md#Messages) with the :sparkles: emoji
4. Send a [PR](../Pull Requests/README.md) before the hour is over
5. Pat yourself on the back :+1:
