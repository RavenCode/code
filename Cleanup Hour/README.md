* Post your cleanup goal in **#dev_cleanup**
  * Avoid conflicts by notifying relevant team members of the files you're cleaning
* Clean
  * Add tests
  * Fix styling
  * Add documentation
  * Simplify implementation
  * Migrate deprecated code
* Commit
  * Remember to prefix your [commit messages](../Commits/README.md#Messages) with :sparkles:

* Pat yourself on the back :+1:
