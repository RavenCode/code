## Golden rule

The codebase should read as one voice - regardless of how many authored it.



<br />
## Annotations

Use annotations whenever necessary to describe any action needed for a snippet of code. Use any of the following as suited:

- `TODO`     : for missing functionality that should be added at a later date
- `FIXME`    : for broken code that must be fixed
- `OPTIMIZE` : for code that is inefficient and may become a bottleneck
- `HACK`     : for the use of a questionable (or ingenious) coding practice
- `REVIEW`   : for code that should be reviewed to confirm implementation
