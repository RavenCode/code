## Flow

1. This is the "when?" and "where?" of this feature
* This happens first
* Then this
* And so forth




## Sub-Features

* [ ] This is the specific "how?" and "what?" of this feature
* [ ] Break it down
  * [ ] How will you achieve your goals?
* [ ] Be as specific as possible
  * [ ] Solve all problems before they occur and discover overlappings
* [ ] These checkboxes are then checked off as you implement the feature
  * [ ] The feature is complete once all checkboxes are checked, meaning *nothing* should be missing from this list
* [ ] Once your architecture is merged, these must be moved to stories in Pivotal Tracker
* [ ] Eg. `<ConversationsContainer>`: A container that will act as the root for the new `<Stack>`, left of `<NotificationsContainer>`




## Migration (optional)

* How will the current architecture be modified to migrate to this new architecture?
* What files will be removed?
* What functions will be deprecated?




## R&D

* Describe results you obtained through research and development
* Reveal any unknowns regarding the feature's feasibility
