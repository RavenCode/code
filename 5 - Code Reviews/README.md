> Hey! I have a request: can you pull my branch?

A Code Review is performed on the proposed changes in a Pull Request. It **must** be done before a Pull Request can be merged.

A Code Review cannot be done by anyone involved in authoring the Pull Request.

Once the review is done, if there are any changes to be made, assign the Pull Request back to the author.

If there are no more changes required, merge the Pull Request and delete the branch.
